// Package narrative provides narrative resources (FUTURE PLACEHOLDER).
//
// This package is a placeholder for future narrative functionality. Narrative
// content is reusable and campaign-agnostic; it does not emit events on its
// own. Events are only created when narrative content becomes canonical within
// a specific campaign (for example, when a GM note is added or a scene change
// is recorded).
//
// # Planned Features
//
// Story Content:
//   - Adventure/module content management
//   - Scene and encounter definitions
//   - NPC dialog and personality
//   - Location descriptions
//
// Narrative Flow:
//   - Story branching and choices
//   - Quest and objective tracking
//   - World state management
//   - Timeline and state progression
//
// AI Integration:
//   - Context building for AI GM
//   - Narrative prompt generation
//   - Response evaluation and canonization
//   - Character voice consistency
//
// # Integration Points
//
// Narrative will integrate with:
//   - Content package for compendium data
//   - Event journal for in-campaign story events
//   - Snapshot projections for world state rebuilds
//   - MCP tools for narrative retrieval
//
// # Limitations
//
// - No user-facing tooling exists yet to append story events.
// - Narrative content alone is not part of campaign history or projections.
// - Story events are only created when narrative changes are tied to a campaign.
//
// # Status
//
// This package is not yet implemented.
