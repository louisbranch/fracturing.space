// Package duality serves as an umbrella for the Duality game engine core logic,
// including dice rolling, rules evaluation, and gRPC services.
//
// The package is organized into two primary subpackages:
//   - domain: Implements the core mechanics of the Duality system, including
//     dice rolling, outcome evaluation for action rolls, and probability calculations.
//   - service: Implements the gRPC API layer, providing a remote interface to
//     the domain logic.
