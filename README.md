Duality Engine is a small, server-authoritative mechanics service
compatible with the Daggerheart Duality Dice system. It provides auditable
mechanical outcomes via gRPC and MCP tools, not narrative content.

## MCP overview

The MCP server lets an LLM connect to Duality Engine tools to assist a GM with
mechanical adjudication, roll outcomes, and campaign setup. Near term, the goal
is to expand this tool set so the MCP layer can help manage and run campaigns
alongside the GM.
