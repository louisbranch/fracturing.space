# Fracturing.Space docs

Fracturing.Space is a server-authoritative, event-sourced engine for tabletop RPG campaigns with gRPC and MCP interfaces.

## Start here

Choose the path that matches your immediate goal:

- I want to contribute code/docs: [Contributors](audience/contributors.md)
- I want to run the stack quickly: [Quickstart (Docker)](running/quickstart.md)
- I want local Go development: [Local development (Go)](running/local-dev.md)
- I want MCP/client integration details: [Clients and tooling](audience/clients.md)
- I am designing/extending systems: [System designers](audience/system-designers.md)

## New contributor quick path

1. Run one setup path: [quickstart](running/quickstart.md) or [local development](running/local-dev.md).
2. Follow [contributor onboarding](audience/contributors.md).
3. Pick a first target from [contributor map](audience/contributor-map.md).
4. Run checks from [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Documentation classes

- Canonical: required for current contributor workflows and runtime behavior.
- Roadmap: active future-facing design/specification work.

Gateway pages prioritize Canonical docs. For Roadmap pages, start from the subsystem entrypoint in [project index](project/index.md).

## Canonical deep dives (open only when needed)

- [Project overview](project/overview.md)
- [Architecture](project/architecture.md)
- [Domain language](project/domain-language.md)
- [Event-driven system](project/event-driven-system.md)
- [Game systems architecture](project/game-systems.md)
- [Testing policy](project/testing-coverage.md)
