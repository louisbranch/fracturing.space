# Project

Architecture, domain model, and subsystem design documentation.

## Canonical core docs

Start here unless you are working on a specific roadmap slice:

- [Overview](overview.md)
- [Architecture](architecture.md)
- [Domain language](domain-language.md)
- [Event-driven system](event-driven-system.md)
- [Game systems](game-systems.md)
- [Event replay](event-replay.md)
- [Testing policy](testing-coverage.md)
- [Testability](testability.md)

## Active roadmap/spec docs

Open only the subsystem you are actively changing:

- Connections: [connections-roadmap.md](connections-roadmap.md)
- Chat: [chat-service.md](chat-service.md)
- AI assignment: [ai-campaign-assignment-phase4.md](ai-campaign-assignment-phase4.md)

## Historical docs policy

Historical/completed implementation logs are intentionally not promoted on onboarding pages. Keep retained historical notes under `docs/notes/` with explicit status/date.
