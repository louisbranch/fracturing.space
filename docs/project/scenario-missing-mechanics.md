# Scenario Missing Mechanics

This document tracks mechanics gaps discovered while running the scenario suite. It focuses on game-system behavior that is missing or incorrect even when the DSL bindings exist.

## Status

Mechanics inventory reflects the first full scenario run after disabling comment validation.

## Glossary of Common Mechanics

Use these definitions to interpret repeated terms in the gaps list without re-reading the SRD.

- Spotlight: the table's active focus. Whoever has the spotlight is the only entity that acts; after the action resolves, the spotlight moves to whoever the fiction or a triggered mechanic indicates.
- Spotlight shift: control passes from the current actor to the next actor. If a shift puts the spotlight on the GM, they immediately take a GM move and may choose which adversary or environment is spotlighted next (spending Fear if required).
- Immediate spotlight: a feature that forces the next action to occur right away (usually the summoned or chosen adversary acts immediately as the next spotlighted entity).
- GM move: the GM's narrative/mechanical response to a roll or opportunity. Moves can introduce attacks, stress, threats, or scene changes. Soft moves offer a response window; hard moves apply consequences immediately.
- Action roll outcomes: Success with Hope (gain Hope), Success with Fear (GM gains Fear), Failure with Hope (gain Hope, GM move), Failure with Fear (GM gains Fear, GM move). Critical Success (matching Duality Dice) is an automatic success with bonus effects.
- Difficulty: the target number a roll must meet or beat. Attacks against PCs use the target's Evasion; attacks against adversaries use the adversary's Difficulty stat.
- Reaction roll: a defensive roll against an incoming attack or hazard. It does not generate Hope or Fear and cannot be aided with Help an Ally.
- Advantage / disadvantage: add (advantage) or subtract (disadvantage) a d6 to the roll total. They cancel one-for-one within the same dice pool. Help an Ally adds a separate advantage die; only the highest helper die applies.
- Help an Ally: spend 1 Hope to roll an advantage die for another PC's action roll; the acting PC adds the highest helper die.
- Hope / Fear: PC metacurrency (Hope) and GM metacurrency (Fear). Hope fuels features; Fear fuels GM moves and adversary/environment Fear Feature(s).
- Resources: Hope, Fear, Stress, Armor Slots, and gold; these are spent, marked, or cleared by features and moves.
- Armor Slots and thresholds: Armor Slots reduce damage severity by one threshold when marked. Damage thresholds determine whether 1, 2, or 3 HP are marked based on final damage after reductions.
- Proficiency: the number of weapon damage dice rolled. It increases dice count only and does not multiply flat damage modifiers.
- Resistance / immunity: resistance halves damage of a type before thresholds; immunity ignores damage of that type.
- Direct damage: damage that cannot be reduced by marking Armor Slots.
- Conditions: Hidden (attacks against you have disadvantage until you are seen or attack), Restrained (cannot move), Vulnerable (attacks against you have advantage). Temporary conditions can be cleared by a successful action roll to escape.
- Movement and range: range bands are Melee, Very Close, Close, Far, Very Far. Features state their maximum ranges; movement and targeting must respect these bands.
- Countdowns: timers that tick down to trigger an effect. Standard countdowns tick on each action roll. Dynamic progress/consequence countdowns tick based on roll outcomes. Loop countdowns reset to their start value when they trigger. Long-term countdowns advance on rests or specific triggers.
- Standard attack: an adversary's primary attack. It uses d20 + attack modifier vs Evasion and deals the listed damage on a hit.
- Fear Feature: a high-impact adversary or environment action that costs Fear in addition to any other costs.
- Spellcasting rules: Spellcast rolls use the subclass Spellcast trait; spells only do what their text says and end per their duration rules.
- Spawn/summon: create one or more adversaries or NPCs at a stated range and add them to the scene; if the feature says to spotlight them, they act immediately.
- Repositioning: the GM updates ranges/line of sight without a roll when a feature explicitly moves or separates characters.
- Environment shift: replace the active environment with another; the GM then uses the new environment's features and may spotlight it immediately.
- Chase: a paired Progress Countdown (PCs) vs Consequence Countdown (opposition). The chase ends when either countdown triggers.
- Social constraint: an ongoing pressure that justifies disadvantage on certain rolls or adds a cost/complication to success.

## Build Order Summary

This ordering shows which system primitives should be implemented before scenario-specific mechanics.

- Adversary actions: standard attacks, multi-target attacks, reactions, fear features.
- Environment actions: hazards, scene-wide effects, spawns, environment shifts.
- Social and economy: social constraints, discounts/penalties, gold tracking, rumor/knowledge rolls.
- Spellcasting rules: Spellcast rolls, spell scope limits, spell duration/termination.
## General Mechanics Gaps

(None currently detected.)

## Daggerheart-Specific Mechanics Gaps

Scenario annotations still call out missing DSL/mechanics. Items are grouped by theme and ordered by priority within each bucket (highest impact first):

### Core roll and damage resolution
Requires: Core rolls and outcomes; Dice modifiers; Resources; Damage pipeline.
- Apply Hope gain, Stress clear, and choose a bonus effect — `internal/test/game/scenarios/action_roll_critical_success.lua`. Trigger: action roll where Hope and Fear dice match. Effects: automatic success, gain 1 Hope, clear 1 Stress, apply critical damage if this is an attack roll, and grant a bonus effect consistent with the fiction. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: modifiers and extra dice must be declared before rolling; a critical counts as a roll with Hope.
- Apply Hope gain and record a narrative complication — `internal/test/game/scenarios/action_roll_failure_with_hope.lua`. Trigger: total below Difficulty with Hope die higher than Fear die. Effects: failure with a minor consequence, gain 1 Hope, spotlight swings to GM for a move. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: GM sets Difficulty and states stakes before the roll.
- Apply multiple advantage/disadvantage sources to a single roll — `internal/test/game/scenarios/advantage_cancellation.lua`. Trigger: roll gains advantage and disadvantage from multiple sources. Effects: advantage and disadvantage dice cancel one-for-one in the same pool; you never roll both; remaining advantage adds a d6, remaining disadvantage subtracts a d6. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: Help an Ally advantage dice are separate and stack by adding the highest helper die to the total.
- Apply the d6 advantage die to the action roll — `internal/test/game/scenarios/advantage_disguise_roll.lua`. Trigger: roll with advantage. Effects: add a d6 to the roll total. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: advantage is granted by a feature, effect, or GM ruling; it cancels with disadvantage in the same pool.
- Spend Hope on help and apply the advantage die — `internal/test/game/scenarios/help_advantage_roll.lua`. Trigger: a PC uses Help an Ally on another PC's action roll. Effects: helper spends 1 Hope, rolls a d6 advantage die, and the acting PC adds the highest helper die if multiple helpers contribute. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: Help is only for action rolls (not reaction rolls).
- Spend Hope and apply an Experience bonus to the roll — `internal/test/game/scenarios/experience_spend_modifier.lua`. Trigger: a PC Utilizes an Experience relevant to the roll. Effects: spend 1 Hope to add that Experience's modifier to the roll total; multiple Experiences can be used by spending multiple Hope. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: must be declared before the roll unless a feature allows after-the-fact modification.
- Force the adversary attack roll to equal Evasion — `internal/test/game/scenarios/evasion_tie_hit.lua`. Trigger: adversary attack roll total equals the target's Evasion. Effects: attack succeeds on a tie. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: adversary attack roll uses d20 + attack modifier vs Evasion.
- Apply max-dice bonus before rolling damage — `internal/test/game/scenarios/critical_damage_maximum.lua`. Trigger: critical success on an attack roll (matching Duality Dice). Effects: roll damage normally, then add the maximum possible result of the damage dice to the total. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: flat modifiers are not doubled; apply resistance/armor after total damage is known.
- Assert tier mapping and HP marked for each tier — `internal/test/game/scenarios/damage_thresholds_example.lua`. Trigger: damage is applied after a successful attack. Effects: compare final damage to Major/Severe thresholds to mark 1, 2, or 3 HP; if damage is reduced to 0 or less, mark no HP. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: tiers map to levels (Tier 1: level 1; Tier 2: levels 2-4; Tier 3: levels 5-7; Tier 4: levels 8-10); apply resistance and other reductions before thresholds.
- Force the damage dice to 3, 5, and 6 — `internal/test/game/scenarios/damage_roll_modifier.lua`. Trigger: a damage roll is resolved with fixed or modified die results. Effects: sum the damage dice results and add flat modifiers once. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: damage dice count equals Proficiency (weapons) or Spellcast trait (spell damage); rerolls or die-setting effects replace the rolled value and the new result must be used.
- Force the damage dice to 3 and 7 — `internal/test/game/scenarios/damage_roll_proficiency.lua`. Trigger: a weapon damage roll uses Proficiency to determine dice count. Effects: roll a number of dice equal to Proficiency, sum results, then add the flat modifier once. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: Proficiency increases dice count only; it does not multiply flat modifiers.

### Combat and adversary actions
Requires: Adversary actions; Spotlight and GM moves; Damage pipeline; Conditions; Resources; Dice modifiers.
- Set the adversary hit, damage total, and armor slot spend — `internal/test/game/scenarios/fear_spotlight_armor_mitigation.lua`. Trigger: GM spends Fear to seize spotlight and make a GM move or spotlight an adversary. Effects: adversary attack uses d20 + attack modifier vs Evasion; on success roll listed damage; target may mark 1 Armor Slot to reduce severity by one threshold. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: Armor Slots available only if Armor Score > 0; marking Armor Slots happens after total damage is known.
- Spend adversary stress and resolve a multi-target adversary attack — `internal/test/game/scenarios/sweeping_attack_all_targets.lua`. Trigger: adversary action that costs Stress and targets multiple creatures. Effects: mark the adversary's Stress cost, make one attack roll, compare to each target's Evasion, and apply damage to each target independently. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: multi-target adversary actions use one attack roll; damage resolution is per target.
- Represent group attack roll and shared damage — `internal/test/game/scenarios/orc_dredge_group_attack.lua`. Trigger: Minion group attack action. Effects: spend Fear, spotlight the Minion group (all Minions within Close range as a single spotlighted entity), make one shared attack roll, and on success each Minion contributes their listed damage; combine damage into a single total. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: combined damage is treated as a single source before thresholds.
- Resolve group attack damage aggregation — `internal/test/game/scenarios/minion_group_attack_rats.lua`. Trigger: group attack succeeds. Effects: add each Minion's damage together, then apply resistance/armor/thresholds once to determine HP marked. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: combined damage is one source for threshold comparison.
- Apply Minion (3) overflow and select extra targets — `internal/test/game/scenarios/minion_overflow_damage.lua`. Trigger: a Minion takes any damage. Effects: Minion is defeated; for every 3 damage dealt, defeat an additional Minion within range the attack would succeed against. Requires: See section Requires.

- Apply Minion (4) overflow and stress marking — `internal/test/game/scenarios/wild_flame_minion_blast.lua`. Trigger: Minion (4) passive on damage; and any linked effect that marks Stress. Effects: defeat additional Minions for every 4 damage; apply any feature-specified Stress marking to affected targets. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: overflow still respects attack range and targeting rules.
- Apply Minion (8) overflow — `internal/test/game/scenarios/minion_high_threshold_imps.lua`. Trigger: Minion (8) passive on damage. Effects: defeat additional Minions for every 8 damage dealt to the initial Minion. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: overflow targets must be within the original attack's valid targeting.

Trigger: Opportunist passive when two or more adversaries are within Very Close range of a target. Effects: double damage dealt by the Opportunist to that target, then apply armor mitigation and thresholds. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: doubling happens before applying Armor Slots and thresholds.
- Assert per-target outcomes and damage tiers — `internal/test/game/scenarios/fireball_orc_pack_multi.lua`. Trigger: multi-target attack roll. Effects: one attack roll and one damage roll, then apply damage and thresholds for each target individually; each target may use armor/resistance separately. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: attack roll is compared to each target's Difficulty/Evasion.
- Adversary reaction roll with an experience bonus — `internal/test/game/scenarios/fireball_golum_reaction.lua`. Trigger: adversary makes a reaction roll to avoid an effect. Effects: roll d20; if GM spends Fear, add a relevant Experience; compare to the effect's Difficulty. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: a natural 20 reaction roll automatically succeeds but grants no extra benefit.
- Apply reactive damage and cooldown on the reaction — `internal/test/game/scenarios/ranged_warding_sphere.lua`. Trigger: reaction such as Warding Sphere when the adversary takes damage within Close range. Effects: deal listed reactive damage to the attacker; reaction is unavailable until refreshed by the specified action. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: reaction triggers regardless of spotlight but obeys its own cooldown rule.
- Apply group reaction rolls and Vulnerable condition — `internal/test/game/scenarios/ranged_snowblind_trap.lua`. Trigger: area effect that calls for reaction rolls from multiple targets. Effects: each target rolls a reaction roll; on failure apply Vulnerable (rolls against them have advantage) and any listed damage/effects; on success apply reduced effect if specified. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: reaction rolls do not generate Hope or Fear.
- Apply disadvantage to the attack and reduce damage severity — `internal/test/game/scenarios/ranged_take_cover.lua`. Trigger: attacks made through cover or a feature that imposes disadvantage and reduces damage. Effects: apply a d6 disadvantage die to the attack roll; if the feature reduces damage severity, downgrade severity by one threshold after damage is totaled. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: disadvantage cancels with advantage in the same pool.
- Apply stress spend and advantage die — `internal/test/game/scenarios/ranged_steady_aim.lua`. Trigger: feature that costs Stress to gain advantage. Effects: mark Stress, then add a d6 advantage die to the roll total. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: must be declared before rolling.
- Move the adversary and spend Stress — `internal/test/game/scenarios/ranged_battle_teleport.lua`. Trigger: adversary feature like Battle Teleport. Effects: mark Stress to teleport within the stated range, then act as allowed (often before/after a standard attack). Requires: See section Requires. Notes: teleport distance obeys range bands.
- Apply scene-wide reaction rolls and half damage on success — `internal/test/game/scenarios/ranged_arcane_artillery.lua`. Trigger: area action that targets all creatures in the scene. Effects: each target makes a reaction roll; on failure take full damage, on success take half. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: reaction rolls do not generate Hope/Fear.
- Apply area hazard, reaction roll, and forced movement — `internal/test/game/scenarios/ranged_eruption_hazard.lua`. Trigger: area hazard action such as Eruption. Effects: targets in the area make reaction rolls; on failure take damage and are forced out of the area; on success take half damage and do not move. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: forced movement uses range bands and does not require additional rolls.
- Apply advantage die, stress cost, and reroll a 1 — `internal/test/game/scenarios/sam_critical_broadsword.lua`. Trigger: feature that grants advantage and allows damage die rerolls. Effects: mark Stress to gain advantage; rerolling dice replaces the original result and the new result must be used. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: rerolls apply only to dice specified by the feature (e.g., damage dice showing 1).
- Apply movement, stress spend, and knockback — `internal/test/game/scenarios/skulk_swift_claws.lua`. Trigger: action that includes movement and knockback with a Stress cost. Effects: move within the allowed range, make the attack, and on success knock the target back to the specified range. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: movement under pressure normally allows up to Close as part of an action; greater distances require an Agility roll unless the feature overrides.
- Apply Hidden and swap in 1d6+6 damage on advantage — `internal/test/game/scenarios/skulk_cloaked_backstab.lua`. Trigger: Cloaked/Hidden state and an attack made with advantage. Effects: while Hidden, attacks against you have disadvantage; if your attack has advantage, apply the Backstab damage upgrade (e.g., 1d6+6) instead of standard damage. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: Hidden ends when you are seen or after you attack; advantage must be present on the attack roll.
- Apply disadvantage to attacks beyond Very Close range — `internal/test/game/scenarios/skulk_reflective_scales.lua`. Trigger: attacks made beyond Very Close range when a feature imposes disadvantage. Effects: add a d6 disadvantage die to the roll. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: cancels with advantage in the same pool.
- Apply group attack resolution and Restrained condition — `internal/test/game/scenarios/skulk_icicle_barb.lua`. Trigger: group attack action that applies Restrained. Effects: shared attack roll; on success, apply damage and Restrained to the target if the feature specifies. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: Restrained prevents movement but allows actions; temporary conditions clear via a successful action roll against the condition.
- Use Better Surrounded to hit all targets in range — `internal/test/game/scenarios/improvised_fear_move_bandit_chain.lua`. Trigger: fear move that upgrades a group attack to hit all targets in range. Effects: make one attack roll and apply it to all targets in range; roll damage once and apply per target if the move specifies shared damage. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: multi-target attack rules apply; spend Fear if the move requires it.
- Apply group attack damage to the target — `internal/test/game/scenarios/improvised_fear_move_bandit_chain.lua`. Trigger: group attack success. Effects: each Minion contributes listed damage; combine and apply as one source. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: apply armor/resistance after combining.
- Move allies to cover and apply Hidden until they attack — `internal/test/game/scenarios/leader_into_bramble.lua`. Trigger: feature that moves allies into cover and grants Hidden. Effects: allies reposition within the stated range; while Hidden, attacks against them have disadvantage and the condition ends when they attack or are seen. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: cover implies disadvantage on attacks through partial obstruction.

Notes: mitigation happens after damage is totaled but before HP is marked.
- Apply advantage to archer attacks while the countdown runs — `internal/test/game/scenarios/head_guard_on_my_signal.lua`. Trigger: On My Signal countdown (5) that ticks when PCs make attack rolls. Effects: when the countdown triggers, all Archer Guards within Far range make standard attacks with advantage against the nearest target; combine damage if multiple succeed on the same target. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: countdown ticks on PC attack rolls; advantage adds a d6.
- Model the Rally Guards action effect — `internal/test/game/scenarios/head_guard_rally_guards.lua`. Trigger: Rally Guards action. Effects: spend 2 Fear to spotlight the Head Guard, then immediately shift the spotlight in turn to up to 2d4 allies within Far range, each of whom takes one action this GM turn. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: these allies act via immediate spotlight shifts as part of the same GM turn; no extra spotlight cost beyond the 2 Fear for this action.

### Group and shared outcomes
Requires: Core rolls and outcomes; Dice modifiers; Spotlight and GM moves.
- Map individual outcomes to a shared consequence — `internal/test/game/scenarios/airship_group_roll.lua`. Trigger: group action roll where one PC leads and others make reaction rolls. Effects: leader gains +1 for each successful reaction roll and -1 for each failed reaction roll; the leader's result determines the shared outcome. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: reaction rolls do not generate Hope or Fear.
- Encode per-supporter outcomes and group bonuses — `internal/test/game/scenarios/group_finesse_sneak.lua`. Trigger: group action roll with multiple supporters. Effects: each supporter makes a reaction roll using an agreed trait; successes and failures modify the leader's roll total as above. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: only the leader's action roll can generate Hope or Fear.
- Assert each participant outcome and any fear/hope changes — `internal/test/game/scenarios/group_action_escape.lua`. Trigger: group action roll resolution. Effects: apply Hope/Fear gain based on the leader's roll only; supporters do not generate Hope/Fear on reaction rolls. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: if the leader rolls with Fear or fails, the spotlight swings to the GM.

### Resource economy and state changes
Requires: Resources; Adversary actions; Spotlight and GM moves.
- Apply group Hope loss and GM Fear gain — `internal/test/game/scenarios/terrifying_hope_loss.lua`. Trigger: Terrifying or similar feature on a successful adversary attack.

- Spend Hope to cast and apply the Fear gain to the GM — `internal/test/game/scenarios/spellcast_hope_cost.lua`. Trigger: spell or feature requires Hope to cast and the roll is resolved. Effects: spend required Hope; if the roll succeeds or fails with Fear, GM gains a Fear. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: Hope spent must be declared before the roll; Hope gained from a roll with Hope can be spent on the same feature.
- Enforce that narration doesn't modify damage — `internal/test/game/scenarios/spellcast_flavor_limits.lua`. Trigger: narration attempts to change mechanical damage. Effects: damage remains as defined by the spell or feature; flavor does not alter damage dice or modifiers. Requires: See section Requires. Notes: only explicit mechanics change rolls or damage.
