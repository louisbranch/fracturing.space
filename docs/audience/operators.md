# Operators

For running the stack locally or in production.

## First action

- Local runtime: [Docker Compose (local)](../running/docker-compose.md)
- Deployment runtime: [Production deployment](../running/production.md)
- Runtime defaults: [Configuration reference](../running/configuration.md)

## Useful files

- Compose topology: `../../docker-compose.yml`
- Topology catalog: `../../topology/services.json`
- Caddy entrypoint: `../../Caddyfile`
- Generated Caddy routes: `../../Caddyfile.routes.generated`

## Next step

After runtime setup, validate service behavior with [integration tests](../running/integration-tests.md).
