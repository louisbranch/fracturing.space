# Clients and tooling

For building clients, bots, or MCP integrations.

## First action

- Protocol and tool surface: [MCP tools and resources](../reference/mcp.md)
- Runtime setup: [Quickstart (Docker)](../running/quickstart.md) or [Local development (Go)](../running/local-dev.md)
- Runtime defaults: [Configuration reference](../running/configuration.md)

## Useful source locations

- gRPC proto definitions: `../../api/proto`

## Next step

When changing MCP behavior, follow the contributor routing in [Contributor map](contributor-map.md) and run MCP-focused tests.
