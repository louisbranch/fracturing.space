# Clients and tooling

For building clients, bots, or MCP integrations.

Start here:

- [MCP tools and resources](../reference/mcp.md)
- [Quickstart (Docker)](../running/quickstart.md)
- [Local development (Go)](../running/local-dev.md)
- [Configuration reference (MCP + OAuth)](../running/configuration.md)

Also useful:

- gRPC proto definitions: `../../api/proto`
